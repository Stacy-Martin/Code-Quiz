# Code-Quiz

I have constructed a timed coding quiz to test user's knowledge of JavaScript. Come play and show your skills!

Credit and thanks to my teacher - Mim Armand, tutor - Alexandra Noto, and classmate - Chris Martinez.

Web site utilizes CSS and a whole lot of JavaScript. 

View (and play!) the quiz live at https://stacy-martin.github.io/Code-Quiz/
